Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a game-changing addition to PLC programming that’s revolutionizing the automation industry. This book equips you with the necessary skills to succeed in the modern automation programming environment.
This second edition is designed to systematically guide you through advanced topics such as OOP design, SOLID programming, the software development life cycle (SDLC), library design, version control, HMI development, general software engineering practices, and more. To hone your programming skills, each chapter has a simulated real-world project that'll enable you to apply the skills you've learned. In all, this book not only covers complex PLC programming topics but also removes the financial barrier that comes with most books, as all examples utilize free software. This means that to follow along, you do not need to purchase any PLC hardware or software.
By the end of this PLC book, you’ll have what it takes to create long-lasting codebases for any modern automation project.
